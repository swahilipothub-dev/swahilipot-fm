The **Pwani Innovation Challenge**, funded by the **World Bank** and spearheaded by Kenya's **Ministry of Trade, Investment and Industry**, is shaking up the entrepreneurship scene in the coastal region. Managed by **Spineberg for Impact**, the challenge aims to boost the entrepreneurial ecosystem and help young entrepreneurs across the Pwani region grow their ideas.

Launched officially on **May 16th, 2024**, the initiative kicked off with a stakeholder engagement session, bringing together key partners from different sectors to shape the program. The aim? To create a challenge that speaks directly to the needs of young business minds in the coastal regions.

Applications were open to youth between the ages of **18 and 35** from **Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita-Taveta, Tana River,** and **Lamu** counties. Whether they had just an idea, a prototype, or nothing at all, young minds were invited to apply. After the application process, the selected participants underwent an exciting **ideation competition**, where they pitched their ideas.

On **September 2nd**, **96 talented entrepreneurs** were officially onboarded after a thorough selection by a panel of judges. Since then, the entrepreneurs have been undergoing training, focusing on **self-discovery** as part of the curriculum.

Today’s launch marks a significant milestone as the public gets to meet the participants of the Pwani Innovation Challenge. The event also aims to create networking opportunities between entrepreneurs and key stakeholders from various sectors, with the hope of sparking collaborations that will take these young businesses to the next level.

There’s more! The Pwani Innovation Challenge is also unveiling a brand-new **website** that will feature profiles of all participating entrepreneurs. This platform will allow anyone to easily access information about the innovative ideas coming out of the challenge and connect with the brilliant minds behind them.

It's an exciting time for young entrepreneurs in Pwani, and with this kind of support and exposure, the future of business in the region looks bright!
